```python

  name = None
  sound = None
 
  def __init__(self, name, species, sound): # missed the 'self'
    self.name = name
    self.species = species
    self.sound = sound

class bird(animal): # missed the inheritance from animal

 def __init__(self): # missed the 'self'
    self.name = "Bird"
    self.species = "Avian"
    self.sound = "Tweet"
    self.color = color


cow = animal("Ermintrude", "Bo Taurus", "Moo")
print(cow.sound)
print(cow.color) # no such property in the animal class.

polly = bird("Green") 
polly.talk()
